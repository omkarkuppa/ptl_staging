/**
  Send a security protocol command to a device that receives data and/or the result
  of one or more commands sent by SendData.
  Mock the SSCP ReceiveData function

  @param  This                         Indicates a pointer to the calling context.
  @param  MediaId                      ID of the medium to receive data from.
  @param  Timeout                      The timeout, in 100ns units, to use for the execution
                                       of the security protocol command. A Timeout value of 0
                                       means that this function will wait indefinitely for the
                                       security protocol command to execute. If Timeout is greater
                                       than zero, then this function will return EFI_TIMEOUT
                                       if the time required to execute the receive data command
                                       is greater than Timeout.
  @param  SecurityProtocolId           The value of the "Security Protocol" parameter of
                                       the security protocol command to be sent.
  @param  SecurityProtocolSpecificData The value of the "Security Protocol Specific" parameter
                                       of the security protocol command to be sent.
  @param  PayloadBufferSize            Size in bytes of the payload data buffer.
  @param  PayloadBuffer                A pointer to a destination buffer to store the security
                                       protocol command specific payload data for the security
                                       protocol command. The caller is responsible for having
                                       either implicit or explicit ownership of the buffer.
  @param  PayloadTransferSize          A pointer to a buffer to store the size in bytes of the
                                       data written to the payload data buffer.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS                  The security protocol command completed successfully.
  @retval EFI_WARN_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL    The PayloadBufferSize was too small to store the available
                                       data from the device. The PayloadBuffer contains the truncated data.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED              The given MediaId does not support security protocol commands.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR             The security protocol command completed with an error.
  @retval EFI_NO_MEDIA                 There is no media in the device.
  @retval EFI_MEDIA_CHANGED            The MediaId is not for the current media.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER        The PayloadBuffer or PayloadTransferSize is NULL and
                                       PayloadBufferSize is non-zero.
  @retval EFI_TIMEOUT                  A timeout occurred while waiting for the security
                                       protocol command to execute.
