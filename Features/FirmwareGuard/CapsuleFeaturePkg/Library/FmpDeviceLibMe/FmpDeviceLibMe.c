/**
  Updates a firmware device with a new firmware image.  This function returns
  EFI_UNSUPPORTED if the firmware image is not updatable.  If the firmware image
  is updatable, the function should perform the following minimal validations
  before proceeding to do the firmware image update.
    - Validate that the image is a supported image for this firmware device.
      Return EFI_ABORTED if the image is not supported.  Additional details
      on why the image is not a supported image may be returned in AbortReason.
    - Validate the data from VendorCode if is not NULL.  Firmware image
      validation must be performed before VendorCode data validation.
      VendorCode data is ignored or considered invalid if image validation
      fails.  Return EFI_ABORTED if the VendorCode data is invalid.

  VendorCode enables vendor to implement vendor-specific firmware image update
  policy.  Null if the caller did not specify the policy or use the default
  policy.  As an example, vendor can implement a policy to allow an option to
  force a firmware image update when the abort reason is due to the new firmware
  image version is older than the current firmware image version or bad image
  checksum.  Sensitive operations such as those wiping the entire firmware image
  and render the device to be non-functional should be encoded in the image
  itself rather than passed with the VendorCode.  AbortReason enables vendor to
  have the option to provide a more detailed description of the abort reason to
  the caller.
