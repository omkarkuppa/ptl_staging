/**
  Create an EFI event in the Ready To Boot Event Group and allows
  the caller to specify a notification function.

  This function abstracts the creation of the Ready to Boot Event.
  The Framework moved from a proprietary to UEFI 2.0 based mechanism.
  This library abstracts the caller from how this event is created to prevent
  to code form having to change with the version of the specification supported.
  If ReadyToBootEvent is NULL, then ASSERT().

  @param  NotifyTpl         The task priority level of the event.
  @param  NotifyFunction    The notification function to call when the event is signaled.
  @param  NotifyContext     The content to pass to NotifyFunction when the event is signaled.
  @param  ReadyToBootEvent  Returns the EFI event returned from gBS->CreateEvent(Ex).

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS       Event was created.
  @retval Other             Event was not created.
