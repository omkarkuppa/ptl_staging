/**
  Prints a debug message to the debug output device if the specified error level is enabled.

  If any bit in ErrorLevel is also set in DebugPrintErrorLevelLib function
  GetDebugPrintErrorLevel (), then print the message specified by Format and the
  associated variable argument list to the debug output device.

  If Format is NULL, then ASSERT().

  If the length of the message string specificed by Format is larger than the maximum allowable
  record length, then directly return and not print it.

  @param  ErrorLevel  The error level of the debug message.
  @param  Format      Format string for the debug message to print.
  @param  Marker      Variable argument list whose contents are accessed
                      based on the format string specified by Format.

/**
  Prints an assert message containing a filename, line number, and description.
  This may be followed by a breakpoint or a dead loop.

  Print a message of the form "ASSERT <FileName>(<LineNumber>): <Description>\n"
  to the debug output device.  If DEBUG_PROPERTY_ASSERT_BREAKPOINT_ENABLED bit of
  PcdDebugProperyMask is set then CpuBreakpoint() is called. Otherwise, if
  DEBUG_PROPERTY_ASSERT_DEADLOOP_ENABLED bit of PcdDebugProperyMask is set then
  CpuDeadLoop() is called.  If neither of these bits are set, then this function
  returns immediately after the message is printed to the debug output device.
  DebugAssert() must actively prevent recursion.  If DebugAssert() is called while
  processing another DebugAssert(), then DebugAssert() must return immediately.

  If FileName is NULL, then a <FileName> string of "(NULL) Filename" is printed.
  If Description is NULL, then a <Description> string of "(NULL) Description" is printed.

  @param  FileName     Pointer to the name of the source file that generated the assert condition.
  @param  LineNumber   The line number in the source file that generated the assert condition
  @param  Description  Pointer to the description of the assert condition.
  @param  DebugPropertyMask  PropertyMask to the description of the assert.
