  <b>PchInit DXE Module Entry Point</b>\n
  - <b>Introduction</b>\n
      The PchInit module is a DXE driver that initializes the Intel Platform Controller Hub
      following the PCH BIOS specification and EDS requirements and recommendations. It consumes
      the PCH_POLICY_HOB SI_POLICY_HOB for expected configurations per policy.
      This is the standard EFI driver point that detects whether there is an supported PCH in
      the system and if so, initializes the chipset.

  - <b>Details</b>\n
    This module is required for initializing the Intel Platform Controller Hub to
    follow the PCH BIOS specification and EDS.
    This includes some initialization sequences, enabling and disabling PCH devices,
    configuring clock gating, RST PCIe Storage Remapping, SATA controller, ASPM of PCIE devices. Right before end of DXE,
    it's responsible to lock down registers for security requirement.

  - @pre
    - PCH PCR base address configured
    - EFI_PCI_HOST_BRIDGE_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION_PROTOCOL
      - This is to ensure that PCI MMIO and IO resource has been prepared and available for this driver to allocate.

    - No modification of this module should be necessary
    - Any modification of this module should follow the PCH BIOS Specification and EDS
